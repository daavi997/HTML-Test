# HTML-test
these are my first lines of html, hope you like it
along these lines I created my first website about a barbershop, with the help of @grupoAlura, which is where I take a programming course.
My goal is to create games using C# and C++ but for now I'm learning programming logic using html and javascript. 
I chose not to upload the images that are in the codes for privacy reasons, because here I used photos from a friend's barbershop. I hope you understand
